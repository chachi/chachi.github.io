title: Will Robots Take Our Jobs?
---

I spoke at [Ignite Boulder 33](http://igniteboulder.com/ignite-boulder-33) in September and it was awesome! Ignite's tagline is _"Enlighten us quickly. Short 5 minute talks about geeky passions hosted in Boulder, Colorado every few months."_ My geeky passion is obviously ðŸ¤–  robots ðŸ¤–, so naturally that's what I talked about.

There's has been a lot of speculation about whether robots will take all our jobs in the next few years, so I thought I'd put my stake in the ground and make my position known. Spoiler: I don't think we'll see mass unemployment thanks to robots.

## Robots In The News

If you're interested in this debate, it's been in the news _a lot_ recently. Vox recently published, in my opinion, one of the better videos on the topic.

The Wall Street Journal's [opinion pages](https://www.google.com/search?q=will+robots+take+our+jobs+site%3Awsj.com) have been the site of a new article every month or so for years now. Rodney Brooks, co-founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics, has a series of articles on the [future of AI and robotics](http://rodneybrooks.com/forai-future-of-robotics-and-artificial-intelligence/) which discuss a bit the future of employment.
