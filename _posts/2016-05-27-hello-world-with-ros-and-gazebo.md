title: Hello World with ROS and Gazebo
---

Over the last ROS has gained a large following and mindshare in the robotics community, both in academia and industry. Its flexibility, ease of use, and wide variety of packages make it great for getting up and running quickly. ROS also has easy integration with the Gazebo simulator making building smart robots even easier.

## First Steps with ROS and Gazebo

Despite all my time working in robotics, I hadn't gotten started with ROS or Gazebo myself until recently. After reading through the excellent ROS documentation, though, I still wasn't totally certain how to do the following things, as illustrated in the GIF above:

1. Load an iRobot Create into a Gazebo world
2. Make the Create drive in a circle with `rospy`
3. Launch it all with `roslaunch`

I consider these 3 steps a sort of ["Hello World"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) for a robotics simulation and I created the [simple_create](http://github.com/chachi/simple_create) repository as an example. I'll cover a few of the pieces here in more detail.

### `package.xml`

This package only needs depend on `rospy` and `std_msgs`, both at build and runtime. `rospy` lets us write the robot's controller in Python and `std_msgs` contains the messages we need to drive the robot, such as the `geometry_msgs/Twist` message.

### `launch/create_world.launch`

The launch file configures the execution of both Gazebo and the node that drives the Create. Here it is in its entirety:

```xml
<launch>
  <!-- We resume the logic in empty_world.launch, changing only the name of the world to be launched -->
  <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
    <!-- Because the world path is relative to GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH, we append to it here. -->
    <env name="GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH" value="$(env GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH):$(find simple_create)"/>
    <arg name="world_name" value="worlds/create.world"/>
    <arg name="paused" value="false"/>
    <arg name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>
    <arg name="gui" value="true"/>
    <arg name="headless" value="false"/>
    <arg name="debug" value="false"/>
  </include>
  <node name="publisher" pkg="simple_create" type="circle.py" required="true" />
</launch>
```

The first block in the launch file is the `<include>` tag where we inherit the `empty_world.launch` file from `gazebo_ros` and override the arguments we need.

Next up the `<env>` tag sets an environment variable to a particular value. In this case, we're appending the `simple_create` package's path to the `GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH`. This is required for the world file to be found by Gazebo.

```xml 
<env name="GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH" value="$(env GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH):$(find simple_create)"/>
```

Each `<arg>` tag has a different command line argument for Gazebo. The `world_name` argument, as expected, contains the path to the world file that specifies the scene.

```xml 
<arg name="world_name" value="worlds/create.world"/>
```

The final line of interest in our launch file creates the node we use to drive the Create:

```xml 
<node name="publisher" pkg="simple_create" type="circle.py" required="true" />
``` 

This tag launches the `circle.py` program from the "simple_create" package, names it "publisher" and, using `required="true"`, fails the whole launch if it is unable to launch. A bit later on we'll investigate `circle.py` and see how it drives the Create.

### `worlds/create.world`

The world file (see the whole thing [here](https://github.com/chachi/simple_create/blob/master/worlds/create.world)) is our definition of the "world", aka everything in our simulation. It's written in [SDF](http://sdformat.org/spec) (an XML schema) and specifies a single world, which is composed of a light source (`model://sun`), a ground plane (`model://ground_plane`), and the robot.

The robot tag here is the most interesting part, so let's look at it in detail.

```xml
    <model name="simple_create">
        <include>
	        <uri>model://create</uri>
        </include>
```

Here we name the model "simple_create" so that it's unique in our scene, then an add an `<include>` tag to inherit from the base Create model attributes. These attributes are accessible through the `create::` namespace.

The final portion of our `simple_create` model is the addition of a `differential_drive_controller` plugin. This plugin allows us to send velocity commands to the Create model inside Gazebo.

Let's look at the more nuanced parts of this `<plugin>` block:

The joint specification tags connect the diff drive plugin to the joints which will move our robot. What's important to note here is the `create::` namespace, derived from the Create's `name="create"` tag inside the create.model file.

```xml
	<leftJoint>create::right_wheel</leftJoint>
	<rightJoint>create::left_wheel</rightJoint>
```

The final lines of interest here are the topic tags. These configure where we'll send/receive messages in ROS about our Create running in Gazebo.

```xml
	<commandTopic>cmd_vel</commandTopic>
	<odometryTopic>odom</odometryTopic>
```

So if we want to send a velocity message to our Create, we'll publish it on the `simple_create/cmd_vel` channel and if we want to listen to the Create's odometry updates, we'll subscribe to `simple_create/odom`.

### `src/circle.py`

`circle.py` is the brains of this operation. Our launch file above defined a `<node>` that starts `circle.py` as a part of our launch graph. 

Here's the entire file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

def main():
    pub = rospy.Publisher('simple_create/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
    rospy.init_node('circler', anonymous=True)

    rate = rospy.Rate(2) # 2hz
    msg = Twist()
    msg.linear.x = 0
    msg.angular.z = 3

    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        msg.linear.x += .2
        pub.publish(msg)
        rate.sleep()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

The top of this file is common to most Python scripts. We add a shebang to specify the interpeter to use, then add our necessary imports. Here we import `rospy`, the Python module of common ROS operations, and the `Twist` message from `geometry_msgs`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
```

The meat of our node is in the `main` function. We'll break this down into parts. First we create a publisher using `rospy.Publisher` that will use the `simple_create/cmd_vel` topic that, as we configured in the world file, is the topic our differential drive plugin is listening on for velocity update messages.

```python
def main():
    pub = rospy.Publisher('simple_create/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)
```

Next we initialize ourselves as a node in the ROS graph. Required for interacting with other ROS nodes.

```python
    rospy.init_node('circler', anonymous=True)
```

Now we come to the setup for our driving code. We create a `rospy.Rate` object to allow us to reliably send velocity estimates at a fixed rate. We also initialize a `Twist` message with some default velocity values. These values set forward motion (linear along x-axis) to zero and yaw velocity (angular around the z-axis) to 3 radians / second.

```python
    rate = rospy.Rate(2) # 2hz
    msg = Twist()
    msg.linear.x = 0
    msg.angular.z = 3
```

The core of our node is the following while loop. Each iteration it checks for a notification from `rospy` to exit, increases our forward velocity, publishes on the `simple_create/cmd_vel` topic, and then uses the `Rate` object to sleep until we want to publish another velocity update.

```python
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        msg.linear.x += .2
        pub.publish(msg)
        rate.sleep()
```

And the last part of file includes the commond `__name__ == '__main__'` check, so that our node may be either an executable, such as when it's a ROS node, or included as a reusable module in unit tests. We also wrap the entire function call in a `ROSInterruptException` try-catch, in the case that ROS exits before we call some ROS function. This keeps us from exiting as a failure and instead allows us to quietly exit as expected.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass
```

### Running `simple_create`

First, clone `simple_create` into the `src/` directory of your [Catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin) workspace. Then rebuild your workspace with `catkin_make` and launch using `roslaunch simple_create create_world.launch`. If you've setup and sourced your ROS and Gazebo environments, this should start the Gazebo GUI and drive your Create in a spiral around your ground plane world.

### Troubleshooting

Be sure to source both the `/opt/ros/<ros-version>/setup.bash` and `/usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh` (or your distro's equivalent) files before calling `roslaunch`.

Additionally, make sure to add the `src` directory of your Catkin workspace to ROS' package path. This way ROS can find our `simple_create` package for launching.

```bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:<catkin-workspace>/src
```
