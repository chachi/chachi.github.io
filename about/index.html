      That's me on the left there with my lovely fiance, Allison, and
      our adorable puppy, Timber. You can now find us in Boulder, CO
      having recently relocated from the much more urban Washington,
      DC.

      I am a member of the the Autonomous Robotics &amp; Perception
      Group (updated website forthcoming)
      at <a href="http://www.cu.edu">The University of
      Colorado</a>. My research interests include [dense] SLAM,
      autonomous navigation, and just generally robots, especially
      those of the <a href="http://robocup.bowdoin.edu">soccer playing
      variety</a>.
