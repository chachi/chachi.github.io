      That's me on the left there with my lovely fiance, Allison, and
      our adorable puppy, Timber. You can now find us in Boulder, CO
      having recently relocated from the much more urban Washington,
      DC.

      I am currently leading the tech effort as a member
      of <a href="http://replicalabs.com">Replica Labs</a>. We're on a
      course to revolutionize shoe buying through computer vision and
      cloud computing. My scientist side's research interests include
      [dense] SLAM, long-term autonomous navigation, and just
      generally robots, especially those of
      the <a href="http://robocup.bowdoin.edu">soccer playing
      variety</a>.
