        That's me on the left there with my beautiful and loving wife
         Allison with our adorable puppy Timber, and our gorgeous
         horse Kota. You can now find us in Boulder, CO enjoying the
         weather, the great Colorado outdoors and the amazing startup
         community here.

        I am currently a computer vision software developer
        with <a href="http://occipital.com">Occipital</a> in
        Boulder. We're building the future of Spatial Computing for
        mobile devices, VR/AR and even robots!

      <p>
        Until recently, I was the CTO
        of <a href="http://replicalabs.com">Replica Labs</a> until we
        <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/occipital-buys-replica-labs-to-help-turn-your-living-room-into-a-video-game-sooner/">joined Occipital</a>. 

        My research/academic interests include [dense] SLAM, long-term
        autonomous navigation, and just generally robots, especially
        those of the <a href="http://robocup.bowdoin.edu">soccer
