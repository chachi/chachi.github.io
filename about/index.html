      That's me on the left with my loving wife Allison and two of our
      three furry family members, Timber and Kota. You can find us
      outside Boulder, CO enjoying the weather, the great Colorado
      outdoors, and the amazing startup community.  I'm currently
      co-founder and CEO of Scythe Robotics, building robots make our
      world a more beautiful place.

      Until recently, I was a computer vision engineer at Occipital. I
      came to Occipital through the acquisition of
      <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/occipital-buys-replica-labs-to-help-turn-your-living-room-into-a-video-game-sooner/">Replica Labs</a> where I was CTO. 

      My research/academic interests include [dense] SLAM, long-term
      autonomous navigation, and just generally robots, especially
      those of the <a href="http://robocup.bowdoin.edu">soccer
        playing variety</a>.
