    That's me on the left there with my lovely girlfriend, Allison, and
    our adorable puppy, Timber.

    I started working in
    the <a href="http://rpg.robotics.gwu.edu">Autonomous Robotics
    &amp; Perception Group</a> at <a href="http://www.gwu.edu">George
    Washington University</a> in August 2013. My research interests
    include dense SLAM, autonomous navigation, and just generally
    robots, especially those of
    the <a href="http://robocup.bowdoin.edu">soccer playing
    variety</a>.
